Yet 29% of individuals estimated to be food-insecure likely do not qualify for federal aid through initiatives such as the Women, Infants and Children program or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Households that earn too much to qualify for SNAP can find themselves caught in a hunger gap, especially if they live in more expensive areas. Nationally, the average cost of a meal was $3.02 in 2017, for example, but counties in the Northeast saw an average meal cost of $3.32, while those in the West saw an average meal cost of $3.27, according to the report.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c17">&quot;Most counties with the highest meal costs (56%) are part of populous metropolitan areas,&quot; the </span><span class="c28"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.feedingamerica.org/sites/default/files/2019-04/2017-map-the-meal-gap-food-price-variation.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1569797284931000">report</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;says. &quot;While these urban counties with high meal costs tend to have lower rates of food insecurity, they are home to large numbers of people who are food insecure.&quot;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Adjusting for inflation, researchers estimated that the annual food budget shortfall for the nation&#39;s 40 million food insecure families reached nearly $21 billion in 2017.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c17 c27">SNAP Addresses the Problem</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Expanding SNAP benefits to more people and addressing barriers to accessing the program &ndash; such as complex application and recertification processes &ndash; are key to reducing food insecurity in the U.S., Gundersen says. Those measures could be particularly important for food-insecure families living in wealthier areas because they also may not know they&#39;re eligible or face stigma for relying on federal aid.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">&quot;SNAP gives these low-income individuals the ability to go to food stores, purchase food that&#39;s correct for their families, and then engage in the civic culture of being able to shop at these stores alongside everybody else,&quot; Gundersen says.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Health care organizations also can leverage their partnerships with local food banks and other community groups to target food insecurity, Dewey says. Local food banks have hosted SNAP nutrition education programs to address diabetes and other health issues, while primary care providers can screen patients for food insecurity and refer them to Feeding America&#39;s services.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">&quot;There is need every county, and we&#39;re striving to meet that need in every community,&quot; Dewey says. &quot;SNAP is hugely important and the first line of defense against hunger, (while) connecting people to healthier foods and different resources is a huge component of addressing this through our partnerships.&quot;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c17">Source: &nbsp;</span><span class="c31"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2019-05-01/food-insecurity-in-america-tied-to-food-prices-poverty&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1569797284932000">https://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2019-05-01/food-insecurity-in-america-tied-to-food-prices-poverty</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15 c22"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c45" id="h.n65zxavpxre3"><span class="c20">Seattle Filipino-led nonprofit serves up pop-up food bank for TSA</span></h3><h5 class="c43" id="h.numfbfprasly"><span class="c0">February 4, 2019</span></h5><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 624.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 624.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c15 c22"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">In the midst of the recently concluded 35-day record-breaking partial government shutdown, a local Seattle nonprofit with a local church and two hotels stepped up to help federal employees during the funding impasse.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">The Be Good Project Foundation a.k.a. BGP teamed up with the Beacon-United Methodist Church, Clarion Hotel in SeaTac and the Seattle Airport Marriott Hotel to set-up a two-day pop-up food pantry on January 26 and 27 respectively.

It was an opportunity for us to lend a hand and help them put food on their table,&rdquo; he added.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Based on the available data, operations and safety protocols remained normal and call-outs were very minimal compared to other airports around the country like New York&rsquo;s JFK Airport which saw a 200% increase of sick-calls from a year ago. &nbsp;At the SeaTac airport, though sufficient, some security checkpoints were mildly limited to accommodate the shortage.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The government shutdown took a lot of us by surprise. Most of us live paycheck-to-paycheck. So this was a very scary ordeal. Obviously, bills had to wait, but hunger doesn&#39;t.&rdquo; said STSO Anastacia Baker who helped coordinate the effort along with Steven Quigley and other fellow supervisors and managers by providing additional or longer break schedule to let Officers participate in the outreach.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">To Baker, it was more than just food. &ldquo;We did all we could to keep up the moral. The biggest help you provided was simply the peace of mind you instilled by providing our Officers a means to provide for our families. All of our officers greatly appreciated your effort. Thank you to everyone who was involved and for being so sensitive and friendly to our officers. The situation was stressful enough as it was. Your assistance, information, instructions and the transportation you provided were particularly helpful,&rdquo; as the Seattle Airport Marriott gladly agreed to let the officers take their airport shuttle to and from their venue.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We were truly honored to be approached by The Be Good Project to be the host venue for their support efforts for local TSA Officers. Being an airport hotel, we feel it&rsquo;s the least we can do to help out our neighbors and families affected by the recent government shutdown,&rdquo; explained Ariel Paull, Seattle Airport Marriott&rsquo;s Director of Catering.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Volunteers from BGP and the Beacon United Methodist Church spent hours, long miles to come up with the donations and carried thousands of pounds of food. Along with the church lead volunteers, youth volunteers were also vital in assisting and welcoming the Officers with a friendly smile and an energetic vibe.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It was fun setting up and helping people carry their groceries. They were not able to take care of themselves because they weren&rsquo;t paid (during the shutdown) so I feel like what we were doing was very important,&rdquo; said youth volunteer Justin Baradi.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">While for Nicole Vicente she said, &ldquo;Helping the TSA officers gave me a chance to learn another aspect of the government shutdown. This whole experience was an eye-opener to see what&rsquo;s really happening in our country and I was glad to be part of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">In total, almost 4,000 lbs of goods were served, about 81 officers on record not including the groceries picked up for their families and fellow Officers who were unable to drop by and 36 volunteers helped the two-day outreach that was extended to February 2 and 3 to accommodate further requests for assistance.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Officers also shared that one reason why a number of their fellow agents were not able to make their shift was due to the lack of money to pay for gas. But one silver lining they said about the shutdown was passengers were nicer and very thankful to them.</span></p><p class="c15 c22"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c12">Help our cause</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c29">Your support and contributions will enable us to meet our goals and improve conditions.
